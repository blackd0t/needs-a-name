- specify in the wiki (human-readable form from dir-spec) exactly
  what keywords we're looking for, error conditions, etc. so we
  have clear specifications for writing tests

- think about what types of data structures we're going to use to
  store persistent information (e.g., should we split up routers 
  into different groups: exits, relays, and guards?)
