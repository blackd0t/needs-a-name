NOTE: see docstrings and PEP 8 and 257 for style justifications
      we should use this style for documentation and code from now on

- make some documentation changes to mimic google style guide for Python
  and to stay conformant with Pep 8

- made some spacing changes wrt Pep 8

- remove getter method.  callers just use raw attribute (Python best practice)
  getters/setters should be avoided in Python.  additionally, deep copy not
  needed.  to parse a different file, just say `r = RDParser(data)`, and 
  things will get re-initialized.  any previous copies of RDParser.values are 
  fine, and Python handles the details for us (Tested: OK)

- changed __keywords to values, so we can do e.g. rd.values['family']

- will anything be inheriting from this? if not, we should remove the
  name mangling (the '__' prefix before functions).  Python really doesn't
  have the concept of 'private' anything, and this convention is really
  just used to prevent namespace collisions in child classes.  if nothing
  will be inheriting here (or if there's little danger of naming problems),
  we should remove '__' prefixes for readability. left in for now, though.
